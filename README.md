Bamazon  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options">CLI</a> app. Meaning you'll be able to see what it does in the images below! I will provide an overview here:
We begin by calling the the Node < file name > this will bring up the Inquirer prompt to purchase an product by its ID & how many you would like to purchase. 


We are connecting our Javascript file to the Mysql database we have created and are selecting a primary ID and matching that to the ID's stock quantity located in another coloumn. We are checking if the ID has enough stock to purchase and are multiplying the price times the amount purchase and removing it from our database.
